2.6.0: Oct 20 2003:
   - Major revision release: should be API and ABI compatible but got a lot
    of change
   - Increased the library modularity, far more options can be stripped out,
    a --with-minimum configuration will weight around 160KBytes
   - Use per parser and per document dictionnary, allocate names and small
    text nodes from the dictionnary
   - Switch to a SAX2 like parser rewrote most of the XML parser core,
    provides namespace resolution and defaulted attributes, minimize memory
    allocations and copies, namespace checking and specific error handling,
    immutable buffers, make predefined entities static structures, etc...
   - rewrote all the error handling in the library, all errors can be
    intercepted at a structured level, with precise information
  available.
   - New simpler and more generic XML and HTML parser APIs, allowing to
    easilly modify the parsing options and reuse parser context for multiple
    consecutive documents.
   - Similar new APIs for the xmlReader, for options and reuse, provided new
    functions to access content as const strings, use them for Python
  bindings
   - a  lot of other smaller API improvements: xmlStrPrintf (Aleksey Sanin),
    Walker i.e. reader on a document tree based on Alfred Mickautsch code,
    make room in nodes for line numbers, reference counting and future PSVI
    extensions, generation of character ranges to be checked with faster
    algorithm (William),  xmlParserMaxDepth (Crutcher Dunnavant), buffer
    access
   - New xmlWriter API provided by Alfred Mickautsch

    zeroOrMore, better error reporting.
   - Python bindings (Stéphane Bidoul), never use stdout for errors
  output

    convention definitions (Igor Zlatkovic), VMS update (Craig A. Berry),
    Windows: threads (Jesse Pelton), Borland compiler (Eric Zurcher,  Igor),
    Mingw (Igor), typos (Mark Vakoc),  beta version (Stephane Bidoul),
    warning cleanups on AIX and MIPS compilers (William Brack), BeOS (Marcin
    'Shard' Konicki)
   - Documentation fixes and README (William Brack), search fix (William),
    tutorial updates (John Fleck), namespace docs (Stefan Kost)

    mode (Justin Fletcher), TLS threads on Windows (Jesse Pelton), XPath bug
    (William), xmlCleanupParser (Marc Liyanage), CDATA output (William), HTTP
    error handling.

    testing,  --nodict for building without tree dictionnary, --nocdata to
    replace CDATA by text, --nsclean to remove surperfluous  namespace
    declarations
   - added xml2-config --libtool-libs option from Kevin P. Fleming
   - a lot of profiling and tuning of the code, speedup patch for
    xmlSearchNs() by Luca Padovani. The xmlReader should do far less
    allocation and it speed should get closer to SAX. Chris Anderson worked
    on speeding and cleaning up repetitive checking code.
   - cleanup of "make tests"
   - libxml-2.0-uninstalled.pc from Malcolm Tredinnick
   - deactivated the broken docBook SGML parser code and plugged the XML

   - output to a given encoding has been added/tested
   - lot of various fixes


2.0.0: Apr 12 2000:
   - First public release of libxml2. If you are using libxml, it's a good
    idea to check the 1.x to 2.x upgrade instructions. NOTE: while initially
    scheduled for Apr 3 the release occurred only on Apr 12 due to massive
    workload.
   - The include are now located under $prefix/include/libxml (instead of
    $prefix/include/gnome-xml), they also are referenced by
    #include <libxml/xxx.h>
    instead of
    #include "xxx.h"
  
   - a new URI module for parsing URIs and following strictly RFC 2396
   - the memory allocation routines used by libxml can now be overloaded
    dynamically by using xmlMemSetup()
   - The previously CVS only tool tester has been renamed
    xmllint and is now installed as part of the libxml2
    package
   - The I/O interface has been revamped. There is now ways to plug in
    specific I/O modules, either at the URI scheme detection level using
    xmlRegisterInputCallbacks()  or by passing I/O functions when creating a
    parser context using xmlCreateIOParserCtxt()
   - there is a C preprocessor macro LIBXML_VERSION providing the version
    number of the libxml module in use
   - a number of optional features of libxml can now be excluded at
    configure time (FTP/HTTP/HTML/XPath/Debug)


2.0.0beta: Mar 14 2000:
   - This is a first Beta release of libxml version 2
   - It's available only fromxmlsoft.org
    FTP, it's packaged as libxml2-2.0.0beta and available as tar and
  RPMs
   - This version is now the head in the Gnome CVS base, the old one is
    available under the tag LIB_XML_1_X
   - This includes a very large set of changes. From a  programmatic point
    of view applications should not have to be modified too much, check the
    upgrade page
   - Some interfaces may changes (especially a bit about encoding).
   - the updates includes:
    fix I18N support. ISO-Latin-x/UTF-8/UTF-16 (nearly) seems correctly
        handled now
      Better handling of entities, especially well-formedness checking
        and proper PEref extensions in external subsets
      DTD conditional sections
      Validation now correctly handle entities content
      change
        structures to accommodate DOM

   - DTD conditional sections
   - Validation now correctly handle entities content
   - change
        structures to accommodate DOM
   - Serious progress were made toward compliance, here are the result of the test against the
    OASIS testsuite (except the Japanese tests since I don't support that
    encoding yet). This URL is rebuilt every couple of hours using the CVS
    head version.


1.8.7: Mar 6 2000:
   - This is a bug fix release:
   - It is possible to disable the ignorable blanks heuristic used by
    libxml-1.x, a new function  xmlKeepBlanksDefault(0) will allow this. Note
    that for adherence to XML spec, this behaviour will be disabled by
    default in 2.x . The same function will allow to keep compatibility for
    old code.
   - Blanks in <a>  </a> constructs are not ignored anymore,
    avoiding heuristic is really the Right Way :-\
   - The unchecked use of snprintf which was breaking libxml-1.8.6
    compilation on some platforms has been fixed
   - nanoftp.c nanohttp.c: Fixed '#' and '?' stripping when processing
  URIs


1.8.6: Jan 31 2000:
   - added a nanoFTP transport module, debugged until the new version of rpmfind can use
    it without troubles


1.8.5: Jan 21 2000:
   - adding APIs to parse a well balanced chunk of XML (production [43] content of the
    XML spec)
   - fixed a hideous bug in xmlGetProp pointed by Rune.Djurhuus@fast.no
   - Jody Goldberg <jgoldberg@home.com> provided another patch trying
    to solve the zlib checks problems
   - The current state in gnome CVS base is expected to ship as 1.8.5 with
    gnumeric soon


1.8.4: Jan 13 2000:
   - bug fixes, reintroduced xmlNewGlobalNs(), fixed xmlNewNs()
   - all exit() call should have been removed from libxml
   - fixed a problem with INCLUDE_WINSOCK on WIN32 platform
   - added newDocFragment()


1.8.3: Jan 5 2000:
   - a Push interface for the XML and HTML parsers
   - a shell-like interface to the document tree (try tester --shell :-)
   - lots of bug fixes and improvement added over XMas holidays
   - fixed the DTD parsing code to work with the xhtml DTD
   - added xmlRemoveProp(), xmlRemoveID() and xmlRemoveRef()
   - Fixed bugs in xmlNewNs()
   - External entity loading code has been revamped, now it uses
    xmlLoadExternalEntity(), some fix on entities processing were added
   - cleaned up WIN32 includes of socket stuff


1.8.2: Dec 21 1999:
   - I got another problem with includes and C++, I hope this issue is fixed
    for good this time
   - Added a few tree modification functions: xmlReplaceNode,
    xmlAddPrevSibling, xmlAddNextSibling, xmlNodeSetName and
    xmlDocSetRootElement
   - Tried to improve the HTML output with help from Chris Lahey


1.8.1: Dec 18 1999:
   - various patches to avoid troubles when using libxml with C++ compilers
    the "namespace" keyword and C escaping in include files
   - a problem in one of the core macros IS_CHAR was corrected
   - fixed a bug introduced in 1.8.0 breaking default namespace processing,
    and more specifically the Dia application
   - fixed a posteriori validation (validation after parsing, or by using a
    Dtd not specified in the original document)
   - fixed a bug in


1.8.0: Dec 12 1999:
   - cleanup, especially memory wise
   - the parser should be more reliable, especially the HTML one, it should
    not crash, whatever the input !
   - Integrated various patches, especially a speedup improvement for large
    dataset from Carl Nygard,
    configure with --with-buffers to enable them.
   - attribute normalization, oops should have been added long ago !
   - attributes defaulted from DTDs should be available, xmlSetProp() now
    does entities escaping by default.


1.7.4: Oct 25 1999:
   - Lots of HTML improvement
   - Fixed some errors when saving both XML and HTML
   - More examples, the regression tests should now look clean
   - Fixed a bug with contiguous charref


1.7.3: Sep 29 1999:
   - portability problems fixed
   - snprintf was used unconditionally, leading to link problems on system
    were it's not available, fixed


1.7.1: Sep 24 1999:
   - The basic type for strings manipulated by libxml has been renamed in
    1.7.1 from CHAR to xmlChar. The reason
    is that CHAR was conflicting with a predefined type on Windows. However
    on non WIN32 environment, compatibility is provided by the way of  a
    #define .
   - Changed another error : the use of a structure field called errno, and
    leading to troubles on platforms where it's a macro


1.7.0: Sep 23 1999:
   - Added the ability to fetch remote DTD or parsed entities, see the nanohttp module.
   - Added an errno to report errors by another mean than a simple printf
    like callback
   - Finished ID/IDREF support and checking when validation
   - Serious memory leaks fixed (there is now a memory wrapper module)
   - Improvement of XPath
    implementation
   - Added an HTML parser front-end
